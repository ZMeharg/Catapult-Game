# Catapult-Game
Game in Python for CS 450

In this game you will be trying to hit targets at different distances. Using some luck ( or basic ideas of physics) you will be able to change where the fulcrum of the catapult will be (allowing a person to adjust the length of the distance arm) along with changing the weight of the object being thrown, along with the height of the catapult. 

Moving forearm length:
  When moving the forearm length, the player will only be able to move the increments in predetermined intervals at this time. Depending on development with the game I might be able to set up the game where the player can slide the fulcrum and the program might be able to calculate the distance.

Calculating the distance traveled:
  Using simply physics equations I will be able to plug in the customizable data into formulas that will determine where the object will land.

Customizing the weight:
  When customizing the weight I will attempt to have a single object in which changing the weight of the object to be either bigger or smaller will change shape size by a percentage. (New Weight/ Original Weight) x Original Image scale

Height of Catapult:
  Another possible way to customize the game

Angles:
  A main component to projectile motion is the angle in which an object is fired, so I might be able to have the angle be customizable.

Randomizing the target:
  I will need to try and find a way to randomize the distance and possible height randomization that will be the same each time you play the game.

Game Layout:
  In this game I would like to attempt to make a trial counter so it counts every time an attempt is made to try and hit the target.
